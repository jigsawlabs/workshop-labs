Ideas for activities


1. Do a wikipedia search for APIs, API mashups, what are some APIs that you may like to mash ups, 
are there any questions in your job or day to day that you could answer with APIs

1. See think wonder with a web url - turn the searching on ESPN and comparison to the web API into see-think-wonder
2. Show the list of APIs, and a list of companies - if we wanted to recreate that company, which APIs could we use.
